== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to get Google Captcha keys? =

You should go to the Settings page and click the 'here' link. Then you should enter your domain name in text field and click 'Create Key' button.
On the next screen you will see your public and private keys.

= How to hide Google Capthca for registered users? =

You should go to the Settings page and select the roles, for which you want to hide Google Captcha.
Then you must click 'Save Changes' button.

= How to chage Google Captcha style? =

You should go to the Settings page and select Theme from dropdown list.
Then you must click the 'Save Changes' button.

= Missing Google Captcha on the comment form? = 

You might have a theme where comments.php is not coded properly. 

Wopdpress version matters. 

(WP2 series) Your theme must have a tag `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` inside the file `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`. 
Most WP2 themes already have it. The best place to put this tag is before the comment textarea, you can move it up if it is below the comment textarea.

(WP3 series) WP3 has a new function comment_form inside of `/wp-includes/comment-template.php`. 
Your theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from comments.php.
WP3 theme does not need the code line `do_action('comment_form'`... inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`.
Instead it uses a new function call inside of comments.php: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
If you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php` (please check the Twenty Ten theme's comments.php for proper example)

= How to use the other language files with CAPTCHA? = 

Here is an example for the German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set a WordPress version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` you should enter `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure the files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` are present in the plugin (the folder "Languages" in the plugin root).

3. If there are no such files you should copy the other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in both files).

4. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file using this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in German.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and in the front-end.

= I would like to add Google Captcha to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Google Captcha plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add google captcha to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the google captcha output.
4. Insert the necessary lines: 

`if( function_exists( 'gglcptch_display' ) ) { echo gglcptch_display(); } ;`

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

`<?php if( function_exists( 'gglcptch_display' ) ) { echo gglcptch_display(); } ; ?>`
